## ‚úÖ Steps to Run This Project

### 1. Open VS Code

Create a folder for your project and open it in VS Code.

### 2. Create Your Python Script

Create a file named `code.py` and paste this code:

```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError

# Replace with your region
region = 'us-east-1'  # or 'ap-south-1', 'us-west-2', etc.
bucket_name = 'bucket174463276'  # Make sure this is unique globally

# Initialize session
session = boto3.session.Session(region_name=region)
s3 = session.client('s3')

try:
    if region == 'us-east-1':
        s3.create_bucket(Bucket=bucket_name)
    else:
        s3.create_bucket(
            Bucket=bucket_name,
            CreateBucketConfiguration={'LocationConstraint': region}
        )
    print(f'Bucket "{bucket_name}" created successfully in {region}')
except ClientError as e:
    if e.response['Error']['Code'] == 'BucketAlreadyOwnedByYou':
        print(f' Bucket "{bucket_name}" already exists and is owned by you.')
    else:
        print(f' Failed to create bucket: {e}')
```

### 3. Set Up AWS CLI (One Time)

If you haven‚Äôt configured AWS CLI yet:

```bash
aws configure
```

You‚Äôll be prompted to enter:
- AWS Access Key ID
- AWS Secret Access Key
- Default region (e.g. `us-east-1`)
- Default output format (press enter for default)

### 4. Install Boto3

In the terminal inside VS Code, run:

```bash
pip install boto3
```

### 5. Run the Script

Run your script using:

```bash
python code.py
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see:

```
Bucket "bucket174463276" created successfully in us-east-1
```

Or a message if the bucket already exists.
